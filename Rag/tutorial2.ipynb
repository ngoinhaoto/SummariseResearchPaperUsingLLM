It provides methods for single- and multi-objective optimization, evolutionary and gradient-based algorithms, kernel-based learning methods, neural networks, and other machine learning techniques. Shark is an object-oriented library that serves as a toolbox for real-world applications and basic research in computational intelligence and machine learning. It is designed for flexibility and speed. The library contains core components such as Rng, Array, and LinAlg, as well as additional functionality. Shark is available under the GNU Public License and can be compiled on various operating systems. It does not require any third-party libraries except for Qt and Qwt for graphical examples. The SHARK project was started by M. Kreutz and later fused with C. Igel's ReClaM library. It has been maintained and revised by a team of contributors. The SHARK library is supported by the Honda Research Institute Europe. \\n\", 'sources': '../pdfs/igel08a.pdf'}\n"
